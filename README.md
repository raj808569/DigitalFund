# DigitalFund - Unified Platform for Relief Funds

# Abstract
The main crux of the app is to create a unified platform for management and distribution of relief funds for minimizing disruption due to natural disasters.

 1) The platform allows volunteers, government officials and other helping members to upload and verify their requirements such as medical supplies, food packages etc. and the estimated cost/fund required for the relief. Multiple users (validated by government for that specific natural calamity-event) can upload their grievances and requirements on the said portal. This will facilitate to allocate, track and utilize the relief funds for speedy and maximized conservation of human resources.

 2) The platform also allows users to raise individual requests on the portal which is validated by nearby government officials on basis of location and current time restrictions. Once validated, the users can, then, upload their requirements such as emergency blood supplies, monetary relief, etc. along with their bank account details or BHIM UPI Barcode/paytm etc.

3) In addtion to the core features above, users will be able to donate for the cause on the platform. They will have the option to pay directly to the users' request (the list will be public and after the payment,the portal will show the remaining requirement for the user) or donate directly to the relief funds. 

4) Another important feature of the app will be the distribution and management of loans. Many people lose their shops, farmers lose their crop, fields etc. The portal will have separate dashboards for several banks. Suppose user A took insurance for house from bank A, said user can raise request on our portal which after validation allows the user to submit one's documents online. After online verification, the insurance is approved. The user can track the progress for his application anytime. Similarly, if someone wants a loan to start afresh, one can apply for loan and submit one's documents. This will help in quick recovery for the farmers who lost their entire crop fields.

5) The officials can also set priority levels on requests based on mutual consent among themselves. Higher Priority levels would be allocated funds and resources first from the main relief fund.

# Conclusion
This app provides a central platform for management and allocation of funds. It allows users to put their requirements and helps the Government better allocate and manage the resources. The entire platform is transparent and allows users to see how much fund is in the primary relief fund along with the individual requirements of the needy. It also allows to set priority levels to see which issues need more attention. It also facilitates quick and online allocation of loans and insurances. Overall, the platform automates the entire process of relief fund management while being fully transparent and thus, corruption free.
